This is just a list of git commands I am currently using. I will keep on adding stuff to it as I use more/different commands. There are tons of tutorials out there as well as quite a few cheat sheets. While those are mostly comprehensive resources, I tend to get distracted and try to learn all commands at once without using them in real projects. That doesn't help much.

### Initialize a local git repository
```
git init
```

### Cloning an existing project from github
```
git clone <project url here>
```
### Status Check
```
git status
```

### Add files
```
git add <files>
```

### Commit changes
```
git commit -m "commit message"
```

### Check log
```
git log
```
### Create a branch and check it out
```
git checkout -b <branch>
```
### Merge branch into master
```
git merge <branch>
```
### Stage all modified files
```
git add -u
```
