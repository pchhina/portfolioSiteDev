<p>While writing code for our project, we often learn new functions and concepts. Unfortunately, we also forget the new knowledge quickly. Some of you might be lucky and remember the first time you read something. For the rest of us, we need deliberate practice. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could practice any new material so we can recall it with ease? I have created a package, <em>quizme</em>, that can help you with that practice. You can build your personal quiz repository by adding questions and answers right from R console. When you want to practice, you can do that also right from the R console!</p>
<div id="how-do-i-get-the-package" class="section level3">
<h3>How do I get the package?</h3>
<p>Package is currently available on Github. You can download it using:</p>
<pre class="r white"><code>library(devtools)
install_github(&quot;pchhina/quizme&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Then we will just load the library as usual:</p>
<pre class="r white"><code>library(quizme)</code></pre>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: On Linux, I would recommend to also install <a href="https://github.com/pchhina/autoquiz">Autoquiz</a> as it simplify the quiz workflow.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-do-i-add-questions" class="section level3">
<h3>How do I add questions?</h3>
<p>Questions can be added with <code>addq()</code>. At the start of the session however, you have to use the function <code>quizme()</code>. This loads the previously created QA list or create blank data structures so new questions can be added.</p>
<pre class="r white"><code>quizme()</code></pre>
<p>With <code>addq()</code>, you can add questions in a single line. Answer must be added in a new line. Answer can contain multiple lines. Carriage return in a blank line will add your question-answer pair to an R object.</p>
<pre class="r white"><code>addq()</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="how-do-i-take-quiz" class="section level3">
<h3>How do I take quiz?</h3>
<p>You would use <code>ask()</code> and a randomly chosen question will be presented at the R console:</p>
<pre class="r white"><code>ask()
#&gt; r: 1 / Inf</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="how-do-i-look-for-the-answer" class="section level3">
<h3>How do I look for the answer?</h3>
<p>The answer to the question that was presented last can be seen using <code>tell()</code> function:</p>
<pre class="r white"><code>tell()
#&gt; 0</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="what-if-dont-know-the-answer" class="section level3">
<h3>What if don’t know the answer?</h3>
<p>If you want to tell quizme me that you don’t know the answer to the current question, you can use <code>miss()</code> function:</p>
<pre class="r white"><code>miss()</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="how-many-questions-are-remaining" class="section level3">
<h3>How many questions are remaining?</h3>
<p>If you want to know the status of your quiz session, you can use <code>show_status()</code> function. In addition you could also use <code>week_ahead()</code> to see number of questions for each day for the next 7 days:</p>
<pre class="r white"><code>show_status()
week_ahead()</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="what-do-i-do-when-i-am-done-practicing" class="section level3">
<h3>What do I do when I am done practicing?</h3>
<p>Simply call <code>bye()</code>. This writes the updated QA data to a file in a directory that was created when <code>(quizme())</code> was called. After that, it also removes the data structures related to testing. And you are done. Happy learning!</p>
