description: R has quite a few built-in data sets that a new user can learn a lot from. Unfortunately, each time you need to look at those data sets, you have to write little code snippets to view plots/tables for understanding. This application comes to your rescue by pulling the available data sets in drop-down menus with plots and summary tables just a click away. Check this application [here](https://param-singh.shinyapps.io/r_data_explorer/).
