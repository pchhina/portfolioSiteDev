description: This is a fun application to explore and learn Tkinter, a python library that interfaces with Tk, a library for building GUIs. The game itself is simple - you try to guess a number between 1 and 100 within 7 trials, but it showcases the use of few elements of graphical user interfaces - buttons, data entry fields and labels. Feel free to check this out at my github account.
