description: A stopwatch built with python library, tkinter. Time is displayed to tenth of a second precision. Beyond the basic stopwatch functionality, a game-mode can be toggled on/off with a checkbox at the bottom. This allows the user to play a game where a player scores a point each time they could stop on a whole second.
